The greedy algorithm is worse than the combinatorial algorithm, as the loss is higher (the difference between losses with max 6 points for the combinatorial selector and max 30 points for the greedy selector is significant), which means a lower quality of the teaching set. The stopping criterion I might use is that there is no lower loss which can refresh the min loss in consecutive 5 points, as selecting multiset does not need to restrict the number of selected points to be the size of the pool $P$. In terms of running time, the greedy algorithm is much faster, and the time cost to add a point is constant, not exponential like the combinatorial algorithm.
